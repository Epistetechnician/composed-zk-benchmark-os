# Phase 370 HSAI Accepted-Append Decision Blocker Review Boundary

State slice: `Phase 370 HSAI accepted-append decision blocker review
boundary`.

Phase 370 defines a docs-first boundary for future local review metadata over
one Phase 369 accepted-append decision blocker. This boundary does not
implement blocker-review metadata, make an accepted append decision, mutate the
accepted Evidence Ledger, change accepted append policy, create accepted formal
evidence, create Level2+ evidence, populate score axes, generate proof
artifacts, generate checker transcripts, generate solver certificates, run
Lean, run SMT, run COBALT, run Rust-to-Lean extraction, submit benchmarks, claim
semantic correctness, claim production readiness, claim SOTA, claim
breakthrough status, claim full security, or grant authority to execute an
action.

## Future Review Purpose

The future blocker review may classify one Phase 369 blocker for local review
readiness while the real accepted append path remains blocked. It may only
review blocker digest consistency, blocker-label consistency, candidate-review
consistency, accepted-append blocker consistency, nonclaim completeness, and
promotion safety.

The future review is not an accepted append decision. It is not an accepted
Evidence Ledger mutation and does not create accepted formal evidence.

## Allowed Future Review Labels

The allowed future review labels are:

- `blocker_review_scope_acceptable`;
- `blocker_review_rejected`;
- `accepted_append_decision_still_blocked`;
- `accepted_ledger_mutation_still_blocked`;
- `level2_evidence_still_blocked`.

The three blocking labels are non-promotional. They do not authorize append
policy changes, ledger mutation, accepted evidence, Level2+ evidence, score
axes, or action execution.

A future accepted-append decision blocker review input must bind:

- one Phase 369 accepted-append decision blocker digest;

## Required Future Validation

A future implementation must reject a blocker review if:

- any required digest is zero or missing;
- the Phase 369 blocker digest is drifted;
- the Phase 369 blocker input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 367 review digest is drifted;
- the Phase 367 review input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 365 candidate digest is drifted;
- the Phase 365 candidate input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 363 review digest is drifted;
- the Phase 363 review input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 361 preflight digest is drifted;
- the Phase 361 preflight input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 359 review digest is drifted;
- the Phase 359 review input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 357 candidate digest is drifted;
- the Phase 357 candidate input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 355 review digest is drifted;
- the Phase 353 manifest digest is drifted;
- the Phase 351 review digest is drifted;
- the Phase 349 preview digest is drifted;
- the Phase 347 package digest is drifted;
- the Phase 345 review record digest is drifted;
- the Phase 343 metadata digest is drifted;
- declared file digest map digest is drifted;
- explicit nonclaims are missing or drifted;
- current accepted append blocker digest is zero, missing, or drifted;
- reviewer policy id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- reviewer decision id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- proposal policy id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- proposal candidate id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- proposal review id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- append preflight id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- append preflight review id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- accepted append decision candidate id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- accepted append decision candidate review id is missing or not a
  single-segment id;
- accepted append decision blocker id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- accepted append decision blocker review id is missing or not a
  single-segment id;
- review decision timestamp is missing;
- Phase 369 blocker state is promoted or drifted;
- candidate disposition, candidate-review label, blocker label, or blocker
  review label is outside its bounded label set;
- review text claims accepted evidence, Level2+ evidence, score-axis evidence,
  proof authority, checker authority, solver-certificate authority, benchmark
  evidence, semantic correctness, production readiness, SOTA, breakthrough
  status, full security, or action authority;
- the review attempts to make an accepted append decision;
- the review attempts to mutate the accepted Evidence Ledger;
- the review attempts to change accepted append policy;
- the review attempts to create accepted formal evidence;
- the review attempts to create Level2+ evidence;
- the review attempts to populate score axes.

## Meaning Limit

The future review may support this claim only:

HSAI can locally review why one accepted-append decision blocker still prevents
an accepted append decision.

It cannot support:

- accepted append decision;
- accepted formal evidence;
- accepted Evidence Ledger mutation;
- accepted append policy change;
- Level2+ evidence;
- score-axis evidence;
- proof authority;
- checker transcript authority;
- solver certificate authority;
- Lean execution evidence;
- SMT execution evidence;
- COBALT execution evidence;
- Rust-to-Lean extraction evidence;
- benchmark evidence;
- semantic correctness;
- production readiness;
- SOTA;
- breakthrough status;
- full security;
- action authority.

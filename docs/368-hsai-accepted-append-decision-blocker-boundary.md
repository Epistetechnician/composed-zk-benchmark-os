# Phase 368 HSAI Accepted-Append Decision Blocker Boundary

State slice: `Phase 368 HSAI accepted-append decision blocker boundary`.

Phase 368 defines a docs-first boundary for future local accepted-append
decision blocker metadata over one Phase 367 accepted-append decision candidate
review. This boundary does not implement decision-blocker metadata, make an
accepted append decision, mutate the accepted Evidence Ledger, change accepted
append policy, create accepted formal evidence, create Level2+ evidence,
populate score axes, generate proof artifacts, generate checker transcripts,
generate solver certificates, run Lean, run SMT, run COBALT, run Rust-to-Lean
extraction, submit benchmarks, claim semantic correctness, claim production
readiness, claim SOTA, claim breakthrough status, claim full security, or grant
authority to execute an action.

## Future Blocker Purpose

The future accepted-append decision blocker may record why one Phase 367 review
still cannot advance into an accepted append decision. It may only summarize
blocker consistency, candidate-review consistency, current accepted append
policy constraints, nonclaim completeness, and promotion safety.

The future blocker is not an accepted append decision. It is not an accepted
Evidence Ledger mutation and does not create accepted formal evidence.

## Allowed Future Blocker Labels

The allowed future blocker labels are:

- `accepted_append_decision_blocked`;
- `accepted_ledger_mutation_blocked`;
- `accepted_formal_evidence_blocked`;
- `level2_evidence_blocked`;
- `score_axis_population_blocked`.

All five labels are non-promotional. They do not authorize append policy
changes, ledger mutation, accepted evidence, Level2+ evidence, score axes, or
action execution.

## Required Future Inputs

A future accepted-append decision blocker input must bind:

- one Phase 367 accepted-append decision candidate review digest;
- one Phase 367 accepted-append decision candidate review input digest;
- one Phase 365 accepted-append decision candidate digest;
- one Phase 365 accepted-append decision candidate input digest;

## Required Future Validation

A future implementation must reject a blocker if:

- any required digest is zero or missing;
- the Phase 367 review digest is drifted;
- the Phase 367 review input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 365 candidate digest is drifted;
- the Phase 365 candidate input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 363 review digest is drifted;
- the Phase 363 review input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 361 preflight digest is drifted;
- the Phase 361 preflight input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 359 review digest is drifted;
- the Phase 359 review input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 357 candidate digest is drifted;
- the Phase 357 candidate input digest is drifted;
- the Phase 355 review digest is drifted;
- the Phase 353 manifest digest is drifted;
- the Phase 351 review digest is drifted;
- the Phase 349 preview digest is drifted;
- the Phase 347 package digest is drifted;
- the Phase 345 review record digest is drifted;
- the Phase 343 metadata digest is drifted;
- declared file digest map digest is drifted;
- explicit nonclaims are missing or drifted;
- current accepted append blocker digest is zero, missing, or drifted;
- reviewer policy id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- reviewer decision id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- proposal policy id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- proposal candidate id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- proposal review id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- append preflight id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- append preflight review id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- accepted append decision candidate id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- accepted append decision candidate review id is missing or not a
  single-segment id;
- accepted append decision blocker id is missing or not a single-segment id;
- blocker decision timestamp is missing;
- Phase 367 review state is promoted or drifted;
- candidate disposition, review label, or blocker label is outside its bounded
  label set;
- blocker text claims accepted evidence, Level2+ evidence, score-axis evidence,
  proof authority, checker authority, solver-certificate authority, benchmark
  evidence, semantic correctness, production readiness, SOTA, breakthrough
  status, full security, or action authority;
- the blocker attempts to mutate the accepted Evidence Ledger;
- the blocker attempts to change accepted append policy;
- the blocker attempts to create accepted formal evidence;
- the blocker attempts to create Level2+ evidence;
- the blocker attempts to populate score axes.

## Meaning Limit

The future blocker may support this claim only:

HSAI can locally record why one accepted-append decision candidate review still
cannot become an accepted append decision.

It cannot support:

- accepted formal evidence;
- accepted Evidence Ledger mutation;
- accepted append policy change;
- Level2+ evidence;
- score-axis evidence;
- proof authority;
- checker transcript authority;
- solver certificate authority;
- Lean execution evidence;
- SMT execution evidence;
- COBALT execution evidence;
- Rust-to-Lean extraction evidence;
- benchmark evidence;
- semantic correctness;
- production readiness;
- SOTA;
- breakthrough status;
- full security;
- action authority.
